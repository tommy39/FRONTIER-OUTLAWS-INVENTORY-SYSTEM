# About
I wanted to create an inventory system that I could use for different prototypes that was easy to expand and re-use with little editor work, as well as being lightweight. The Inventory system I chose to create is heavily inspired by 'RUST'

#### | Key Features

**Drag and Drop:**  Items in the inventory can be dragged by holding left click on them and then placing them in target slot by releasing the left click input over a slot, items can be only placed in slots that they are compatible with (e.g. a sword cannot be placed in the headgear slot).

**Weapons:**  Equip different weapon types including two-handed and dual-wielding, based on what type of weapons are equipped the preview render character will also play different types of animations.

**Clothing:**  Equip different items of clothing and automatically have the bones of the two rigs combined and detached when unequipping different items.

**Different Inventory Types:**  Inventories can be assigned different items such as characters or storage boxes as all inventory slots can be assigned different types of items that they can accept.

**Icon Creator:**  Comes with an icon-creator tool that allows an item to be selected and have its position and rotation modified. Then when the user is happy with how it looks in the camera they can take a screenshot of it which will automatically be stored as a sprite and apply it to the Items scriptable object as its icon for the inventory).
